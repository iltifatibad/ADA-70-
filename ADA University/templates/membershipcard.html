                            Taking into account the Minimum age requirement of 11 years, anyone who wishes can become a member of society, regardless of the field of study, position, status, country of residence, race, religion, nationality. By paying only $ 4 per month, a person can register as a member of the community and get a membership card. When registering, select the country segment, fill in the blank fields, provide the active phone number and E-mail address. It is possible to carry out all operations and make payments by accessing the “membership card” section, which is indicated at the top of the website. Membership fee for citizens of all countries is provided for the same amount. Each member who acquires membership can benefit from about thirty services (as well as all future services) offered by the society on the platform free of charge. However, if the membership fee is not paid in the following months, the membership will be terminated and the person's membership will not be restored again. This will deprive the person from other registration processes and services. An increase in the number of services to be offered after a certain period of time is not excluded. To take advantage of the services, it is imperative to register and get a membership. After registering, each member will receive a personal “user password” at that moment and will be able to access their personal account from different devices through that password. Only with” User Password " members can go through the registration process of all types of services offered. Therefore, the “user password" is very important for every member and should not be forgotten. Members who have forgotten their user password can apply for password recovery. One of the biggest advantages is that every member of the company will be informed about all future activities and services of the company by E-mail and SMS in advance.
